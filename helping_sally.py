business-name = 'Sally's Fruity Loops'

This is the list of all the fruits I'll be selling

fruit-list = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherries", "Dragon Fruit" Fig
               Grapefruit "Kiwi", "Lemon" Lime" Mango" "Oranges", "Pineapple
              "Grapes" Watermelon".]

This is the list of the prices of each fruit in the fruit list.

fruit_prices-list = [ 1.35, 1.30 0.32 0.60 0.80 1.76 3.32 0.34 2 3 2.46 1.43
                      1.8 1.9.]

Check if the first item in the fruit list is apple and then display
a notice to customers.

if fruit-list[0] == "apple":
print("Sally sells apples too!").


Calculate how much discount to give customers on opening day
by adding the prices of the first 2 fruits, divide by 100 and
multiply by 5

discount-amount = (1.35 + 1.30 / 100) * 5
discount-percent = discount-price
print("Thanks for being a valued customer! Your discount is: ", discount-percent, "%")

'' The code below will be used to show customers a list of random fruits on sale. ''

first sample from fruit-list = fruit-list[1]
second sample from fruit-list = fruit-list[13]
third sample from fruit-list = fruit-list[9]
fourth sample from fruit-list = fruit-list[17]
fifth sample from fruit-list = fruit-list[1]

print("Here are the fruits on sale today:")
print(first sample from fruit-list)
print(second sample from fruit-lists)
print(third samples from fruit-list)
print(fourth sample from fruit-lists)

This is a list of the first three fruits. I'll give these for free on my birthday

1fruit, 2fruit, 3fruit = fruit-list[1],fruit-list[2],fruit-list[3]
print(1fruit, 2fruit, 3fruit).

Declare a variable to store a customer's shopping cart total BEFORE they start shopping'

customer-total = 

This is the raw string that will be displayed on the homepage of the store's website
The website can process newline characters (\n) and turn them into smiley faces,
so we'll need those to show when the string is printed

Raw_Welcome = "Welcome to Sally's \n fruity loop store"
print(raw_welcome)

Check that the customer cart total works properly by testing the cart total functionality

customer-total = customer-total + 10
print(customer-total).

Declare a string to thank a customer for shopping and show them their cart total
after ordering:

goodbye_msg = "Thanks for shopping at Sally's Fruity Loops'
print("Your total for today is: Customer-Total")

```
